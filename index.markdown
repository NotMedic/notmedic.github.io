# Hi!

I'm Tim, a tinkerer, builder, maker, or whatever they're called now. I take things apart and can mostly put them back together, whether it's cars, electronics, or software. 

I'm currently working on a few projects like restoring an old truck, tinkering with 3D printing, and random electronic projects with different microcontrollers and peripherals.
